<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div align='justify';>
<p>
In this project, I will be exploring the use of Different Regressor machine learning algorithms such Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, K-Neighbors Regressor,and XGB Regressor for forecasting an online bike sharing application in Seoul, South Korea which we will be comparing from each others performance and see which has the best out of all of them. In the dataset, there is a wide array of variables that can be utilized for this analysis such as Visibility, Rainfall, Snowfall, Holiday, Season, Temperature, Humidity, and more. In this analysis, I have converted some of these variables into categorical variables as I think it would be more useful for the model instead of numerical values. I have also conducted an exploratory data analysis to analyze the behavior of the dataset. I have also conducted two different types of models where I convert some of the values to categorical, and one that I have not to see how well the model performs.
